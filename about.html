		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>
			This is a little about me. I have a wife and a baby. I work at a tech company doing sales. I want to become a software developer. 
			I also want to run for president some day but we'll see what happens there.
			I love BYU football to the unhealthiest degree. I get so angry when they lose.
			To be honest, this wasn't part of the assignment but I just didn't like the lorem ipsum on there so I figured I'd write my own stuff.
			I have been at devmountain for about six weeks now and it's been great.
			John and Norman are both great dudes. They're super helpful. Also this was a way easier assessment than the last one.
			Thanks for listening to me rant about random stuff. Also go Jazz. I hope they win the finals this year.
			Also I'm afraid of bees. I have been diagnosed with a phobia of bees/wasps. It's called <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_bees">melissophobia.</a>
